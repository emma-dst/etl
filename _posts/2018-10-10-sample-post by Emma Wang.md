Amazon.com Inc.’s stock selloff might seem huge, given that it has erased over $10 billion in market value, but it is actually headed for the smallest one-day post-earnings decline in seven years.
The e-commerce giant reported late Thursday second-quarter earnings per share that fell to 40 cents from $1.78 a year ago, and missed the FactSet consensus of $1.41. The miss on a percentage basis was by 71.6%, the biggest since Amazon reported a loss that was 72.3% wider than expected for the second quarter of 2014.
